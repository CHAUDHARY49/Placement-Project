# Placement-Project
This project aims to build a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts whether a student is likely to be placed in a company based on their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores. The goal is to develop an automated system that can predict placement eligibility by analyzing the key factors that are typically considered by recruiters.
