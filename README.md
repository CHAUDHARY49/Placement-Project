# Placement-Project
This project aims to build a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts whether a student is likely to be placed in a company based on their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores. The goal is to develop an automated system that can predict placement eligibility by analyzing the key factors that are typically considered by recruiters.

Introduction:

Overview of the project and its goals.
Importance of placement predictions in the context of student career development.

Data Collection and Analysis:

Source and format of the data used for training.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and relationships between CGPA, IQ, and placement results.

Machine Learning Algorithms:

Overview of different algorithms explored (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Justification for the choice of final algorithm based on model performance.

Model Training and Testing:

How the data is split into training and testing sets.
Training of the machine learning model and fine-tuning for optimal performance.

Performance Evaluation:

Explanation of evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
Analysis of the results from the validation phase.

User Interface Development:

Design and features of the user interface.
Interaction between the user and the model for real-time placement prediction.

Conclusion and Future Work:

Summary of the projectâ€™s findings.
Potential for improvements and future work, such as incorporating more features like skills or internships.
